"Working the Issue" refers to the process of actively investigating, troubleshooting, and resolving a ticket after it has been assigned to an agent. This is the stage in the ticket lifecycle where agents or support staff take action to solve the user's problem or address their request. The focus is on problem-solving and providing a resolution based on the issue reported by the user.

Resolution is the final stage in the ticket lifecycle where the issue reported by the customer has been successfully addressed, and the ticket is closed. It's the point where the agent confirms that the problem has been resolved, and the userâ€™s needs have been met. The goal of this phase is to ensure that the solution provided effectively fixes the issue and that the customer is satisfied.
